Binary Heart Classification By Ali Kassira 

This project was intended to apply an LSTM model in order to classify heart beat rhythms
Initially, this was a multi-class classification problem, however found discrepencies and errors within the data 
this included added noise, unusable samples, unbalanced classes, etc.

The project was recently made to fit a new dataset, which did not get enough attention, however, much research was made
in order to fully grasp what is going on 

many feature extraction techniques needed to be dropped as the computations were too exhaustive for on my machine. 

CUDA would have helped tremendously as well, as I could not finish more than 20 epochs without crashing
