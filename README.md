Binary Heart Classification By Ali Kassira 

Heart Disease is known to be the one killer in the world. This could potentially change with newer technologies in the world. Heart rhythms may quickly be identified with the aid of modern technology, such as wearable devices which could identify an at-risk patient if their heartbeat is normal or not. In todays society, this could be achievable with the proper resources avaialble. I intend to classify heartbeats with an LSTM model. 

This project was intended to apply an LSTM model in order to classify heart beat rhythms. Initially, this was a multi-class classification problem, however found discrepencies and errors within the data. This included added noise, unusable samples, unbalanced classes, etc.

The project was recently made to fit a new dataset, which the data did not get the attention it diserved. However, much research was made
in order to fully grasp what is going on. Many feature extraction techniques needed to be dropped as the computations were too exhaustive for on my machine. 

CUDA would have helped tremendously as well, as I could not finish more than 20 epochs without crashing

I am thankful for having this opportunity to learn about signals, fourier transformations and feature extraction

Much more can and will be done
